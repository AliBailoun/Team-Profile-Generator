# Team-Profile-Generator
This is a professional team profile generator that you can use to organize the team members of your team (given that that team consists of managers, engineers and iterns), where each member can display their basic information in a readable format in a web page along with their emails and github repositories which are both one click away.

### How to use:
1. Open a new terminal
2. Type in app.js
3. Answer the questions that follow
4. Select the output folder and open the newly-generated html page.
